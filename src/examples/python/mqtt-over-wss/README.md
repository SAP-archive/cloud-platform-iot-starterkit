The example in this directory demonstrates the usage of MQTT over WSS for upstream (publish) and downstream (receive messages for the "push" topic you subscribed to) interaction of a device. You can either use  OAuth or a Client Certificate (works only on beta-enabled accounts on PROD) to authenticate the device. There is also an example on how to register and authenticate a device using [Client Certificate Authentication](../../auth).

It uses the Eclipse Paho Python MQTT lib that needs a small patch in order to allow a arbitrary (not just /mqtt) path for the WebSocket application. Please find the instructions for installing a patched version of the library below. We also work (pull request is issued) on getting the patch into the official version so that the patch is no longer necessary.

```
