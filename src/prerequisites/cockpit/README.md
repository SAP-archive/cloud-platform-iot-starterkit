## Create Device Information in Internet of Things Cockpit

>Previous Step [Enable Internet of Things](../service)

The following description of interaction steps with the Internet of Things Cockpit
shows you how to create a Device Type and Message Types associated with it as well as a Device instance.

Remark: The specific values that you create in this process as well as the
specific OAuth Authorization Token for your Device instance need to be used to adapt
the [configuration file config.py](../../examples/python/iot-starterkit-for-desktop/template-config.py) for the example
applications.

* Open Internet of Things Cockpit
 * Press on the Go to Service icon of the Internet of Things Services subscription.
 * The Internet of Things Cockpit will open.
 
Further information: [`Internet of Things`](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/iot) > Getting Started > Accessing the Internet of Things Cockpit 


* Create Message Type
 * Press on Message Types tile in your Internet of Things Cockpit.
 * Press on the + button to add a new message type.
 * Enter a Name for the message type.
 * Enter a Name and select a Type for the first row of the Fields table.
 * Optional: Add additional Fields by pressing on the + button on the top right corner of the Fields table.
 * Press on Create to continue.

The examples in the Starter Kit use the following specific Message Types that you should also create in order to make the code working without any necessary modification:
```
	sensor:string
	value:string
	timestamp:date
```

```
	opcode:string
	operand:string
```

Further information: [`Internet of Things`](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/iot) > Internet of Things Cockpit > Configuring Message Type.


* Create Device Type
  * Press on Device Types tile in your Internet of Things Cockpit.
  * Press on the + button to add a new device type.
  * Enter a Name for the device type.
  * Press the + button in the Message Types table to add message type assignments
    * Enter an optional assignment name. If left empty, the message type name is used as assignment name.
    * Choose the message type you want to assign.
    * Choose the message direction.
  * Press on Create to continue.

For the example in the Starter Kit create a new Device Type with the following two message type assignments:
* Assignment 1
```
	Message Type: OutboundMessage
 	Direction: From Device
```
* Assignment 2
```
	Message Type: InboundMessage
	Direction: To Device
```

Further information: [`Internet of Things`](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/iot) > Internet of Things Cockpit > Configuring Device Type.


* Create Device
 * Press on Devices tile in your Internet of Things Cockpit.
 * Press on the + button to add a new device.
 * Enter a Name for the device.
 * Select the Device Type for the new device from the drop down menu.
 * Press on Create to continue.

![IoT Cockpit - Device Example](../../../images/iot_cockpit_add_device_01.png "IoT Cockpit - Device Example")

 * You will see a pop-up window Device Token Generated including the Token ID generated for the new device.

![IoT Cockpit - OAuth Token Example](../../../images/iot_cockpit_add_device_02.png "IoT Cockpit - OAuth Token Example")

 * Copy the generated Device Token since it is needed on the device as OAuth credential for secure communication with the services.

Further information: [`Internet of Things`](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/iot) > Internet of Things Cockpit > Configuring Device.

* Final result
 * You should now have created at least 1 Device Type with 2 associated Message Types and 1 Device instance.

## Automated Device Registration with Python and RDMS API

The steps described above could be automated with the exposed RDMS RESTful API. Following the link you will find a [Python Script](../../examples/python/device_registration_via_api) responsible for respective Device Type, Message Types and Device registration. 

### Authentication mechanisms
Communication with the SAP Cloud Platform Internet of Things is protected by 2 different authentication mechanisms.
* IoT Devices use OAuth authentication with a respective OAuth token for an individual device provided via the Internet of Things Cockpit
* Applications that trigger interactions with devices via SAP Cloud Platform Internet of Things or consume data provided by these use Basic Authentication with the respective credentials for the individual user of the SAP Cloud Platform account

Respective credential usage is part of the provided source code examples.
