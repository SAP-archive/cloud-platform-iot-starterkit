The IoT Starter Kit supports the Raspberry Pi with peripherals attached via a
GrovePi shield and programmed in Python.  In the example we use a Slide
Potentiometer for the input of values that can be changed by the user as well
as an LED and an OLED graphical display for visible output.

Please follow these steps to get the example up and running:
* Install a Raspbian Linux distribution following the instructions and downloadable images from https://www.raspberrypi.org
* Configure the Raspberry Pi to have appropriate network connectivity (we support operation both without and with an HTTP proxy) and make sure your installation is up-to-date using the ```apt-get update; apt-get upgrade``` mechanism
* Install urllib3 with ```sudo apt-get install python-urllib3```
* Install and test the GrovePi software as described at http://www.dexterindustries.com/GrovePi/get-started-with-the-grovepi/
* Go to the GrovePi/Software/Python directory and do a ```sudo python setup.py install``` to install the GrovePi modules for all users of the system
* Copy the file necessary for OLED support to the appropriate installation place with ```sudo cp grove_oled/grove_oled.py /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/grovepi-0.0.0-py2.7.egg``` 
* Connect the Slide Potentiometer to A0, the LED to D4 and the OLED display to I2C-1
* Install the files [iot_starterkit_pi_and_grove_peripherals.py](../../examples/python/iot-starterkit-for-pi-and-grove-peripherals/iot_starterkit_pi_and_grove_peripherals.py) as well as [config.py](../../examples/python/iot-starterkit-for-pi-and-grove-peripherals/template-config.py) and configure for your SAP Cloud Platform Trial account, credentials, Device and Message Types in [config.py](../../examples/python/iot-starterkit-for-pi-and-grove-peripherals/template-config.py)
* Start the program as root (```sudo bash``` lets you get root in case you have not been already) with ```python iot_starterkit_pi_and_grove_peripherals.py```
* Interact with the respective control and consumption mechanisms as described for desktop usage already
* You can stop the running program with ```Ctrl+C```
