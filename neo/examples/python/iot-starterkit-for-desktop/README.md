In order to use the desktop programs you need to have a suitable Python
environment (both 2.7 as well as 3.4 are supported) on your system. Python is
pre-installed on OSX and available at https://www.python.org for Windows.

In addition you need the [urllib3 module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/urllib3)
installed.

All account and network specific settings, the configuration of your Device
instance ID and associated credentials as well as your Message Type IDs need to
be done in the file
[config.py](./template-config.py).
