# Flexible ingest from an external MQTT broker
Imagine you already have a device that publishes its data to an external MQTT broker where its message format as well as MQTT topic do not conform to what the [MQTT over TCP Data Service](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/iot/frameset.htm?a9764708d68b43e59c823218d1aa6346.html) expects.  

We provide example code for such a scenario here. It uses IoT (Java) application hosted in the SAP Cloud Platform which is capable to subscribe for incoming MQTT messages, transform the payload to Message Management Service (MMS) compatible format and publish the message to MMS using its [MQTT over WebSocket Data Service](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/iot/frameset.htm?56d02092904346c1a605713021d2f875.html)

>The MQTT Ingest application cab be hosted in the same consumer account where MMS is deployed.

## Prerequisites
* You have basic knowledge about Git and Maven
* You know how to deploy Java applications on SAP Cloud Platform
* You have SAP Cloud Platform Internet of Things enabled and configured for your account
* You have basic understanding about the MQTT protocol

## Import project
An application is provided as a Maven project and can be imported to the IDE workspace with the respective plug-in or IDE embedded import functionality.

## Compile project
Build a WAR archive with Maven. Run `mvn clean install` either from the command line or from IDE. You will find your WAR archive then under the project's `/target` directory.

#Example setup
In our example an Arduino compatible LoRaWAN node called [Badgerboard](http://badgerboard.io) sends its sensor data to the LoRaWAN. The Things Network [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org) exposes data for consumption via an [MQTT Broker](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/mqtt) 

![TTN Pipeline](../../../../images/mqttingest/mqttingest_tam_ttn.jpg "TTN Pipeline")  

##Input format
A device is publishing its sensor data for topic `ttnappid/devices/ttndeviceid/up`. A payload at the MQTT Broker side will then look like:
```
{ 
   "app_id":"ttnappid",
   "dev_id":"ttndeviceid",
   "hardware_serial":"00A1B1506523DE20",
   "port":2,
   "counter":1176,
   "payload_raw":"DO0KWQ1H",
   "payload_fields":{ 
      "battery":3.399,
      "celcius":33.09,
      "fahrenheit":91.56,
      "humidity":26.49
   },
   "metadata":{ 
      "time":"2017-02-21T16:38:55.081110224Z",
      "frequency":862.5,
      "modulation":"LORA",
      "data_rate":"SF7BW125",
      "coding_rate":"4/5",
      "gateways":[ 
         { 
            "gtw_id":"eui-b123ebddde37f76a",
            "timestamp":1220910331,
            "time":"2017-02-21T16:38:55.062545Z",
            "channel":2,
            "rssi":-73,
            "snr":6.8,
            "rf_chain":1,
            "latitude":51.03304,
            "longitude":13.7086813
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

##Preparatory work
We need to manage the Device and Message Type first, so that the MQTT Ingest application and MMS understand each other.  
1. Create a Message Type with the fields you would like to have published to MMS  
![MT Info](../../../../images/mqttingest/mms_message_type_info.jpg "MT Info") 
![MT Fields](../../../../images/mqttingest/mms_message_type_fields.jpg "MT Fields") 
2. Create a Device Type for your Badgerboard devices  
![DT Info](../../../../images/mqttingest/mms_device_type_info.jpg "DT Info") 
![DT Messages](../../../../images/mqttingest/mms_device_type_messages.jpg "DT Messages") 
3. Create a concrete Device 
![Device](../../../../images/mqttingest/mms_device.jpg "Device") 

##Output format
Based on the Prepartory work above, the MQTT Ingest application is supposed to publish messages for topic `iot/data/b141d8f7-4013-49a5-93b8-c342727c150a` with the following payload
```
{  
   "mode":"async",
   "messageType":"ee7fa864f7f27492f039",
   "messages":[  
      {  
         "battery":3.399,
         "celcius":33.09,
         "fahrenheit":91.56,
         "humidity":26.49,
         "timestamp":"2017-02-21T16:38:55.081110224Z"
      }
   ]
}
```

##MQTT Ingest Deployment
We already have our MQTT Ingest WAR archive. Simply, deploy it to SAP Cloud Platform from the Cockpit. 

![Deployment](../../../../images/mqttingest/mqttingest_deploy.jpg "Deployment") 

>You may also deploy the WAR from command line interface.  

After deployment is done, the application has to be started. At the end, you will have 2 applications running in your account.  

![Status](../../../../images/mqttingest/mqttingest_status.jpg "Status") 

The MQTT Ingest application requires your user to be assigned to the predefined `MQTT-Ingest-User` role, so do not forget to make an assignment before you open the application URL.

![Role](../../../../images/mqttingest/mqttingest_role.jpg "Role") 

##MQTT Ingest Configuration
Navigate to the MQTT Ingest Overview and open the application URL  

![Overview](../../../../images/mqttingest/mqttingest_overview.jpg "Overview") 

The application provides a very simplistic UI. At the very first launch you will get a HTTP 404 error, which indicates that there is no configuration found by the MQTT Ingest, hence no MQTT subscriber and publisher are there to handle messages.

![No Configuration](../../../../images/mqttingest/mqttingest_no_config.jpg "No Configuration") 

Press on the button at top-right corner to show the configuration template

![Template](../../../../images/mqttingest/mqttingest_template.jpg "Template") 

Adapt the necessary values and press the Run button to save and activate your configuration. This will create two MQTT clients (namely subscriber and publisher) which will listen to / send messages, respectively. The `mapping` section in the configuration is responsible to describe the mapping between the two formats. In this particular case both input and output are JSON where hierarchical structure of the input is mapped to flat structure of the output.

>Pressing on Terminate button will disconnect the existing MQTT clients and remove the configuration. You may always reconfigure by providing the new configuration settings and hit Run, this will disconnect current clients and connect new ones.

##Checking the result
After everything is configured and a device is publishing its sensor data, you will receive it in MMS and can visualize it in the MMS Cockpit.  

![Result](../../../../images/mqttingest/mqttingest_result.jpg "Result") 

#For your consideration
>Such kind of configurations where a user needs to specify endpoints, user credentials etc are supposed to be done using platform specific features like [Destinations](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/help/frameset.htm?e4f1d97cbb571014a247d10f9f9a685d.html). It is highly recommended to follow that approach for productive usage. This example application and its setup were simplified intentionally.
