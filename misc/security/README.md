# Security aspects

Security plays a very important role for the deployment of IoT scenarios in
productive environments. The Starterkit examples concentrate of the aspect of
demonstrating basic IoT Services mechanisms. Whereas some code snippets
show how to harden a solution against e.g. Man-in-the-Middle attacks that try
to spoof a HCP server in order to get access to sensitive payloads or
credentials this is not generally the case for all examples and other security
aspects like e.g. the integrity of the execution environment for an edge client
are so far not covered. Inherently, specific usable security mechanisms differ
for different programming languages, frameworks or hardware platforms. Thus,
before making use of code snippets or integrated examples in productive
scenarios please pay additional attention on hardening against potential
attacks. We will continously provide further guidance on potential attack
vectors and how to harden your solution on this page.
