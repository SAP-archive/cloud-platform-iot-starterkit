These samples show the integration with an ingesting (upstream) HTTP client or
receiving (downstream) HTTP server.  We indicate potential EXTENSION POINTS
where the further enhancement for specific usage can be done.

The IoT Service specific creation of device instances with their specifics
(capabilities with properties, sensortypes, sensors) can be done with the basic
samples we provide for this purpose and is assumed as a precondition for sample
usage.
