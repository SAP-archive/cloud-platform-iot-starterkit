Starting from June 2017 we provide initial coverage for the SAP Cloud Platform Internet of Things for the Cloud Foundry Environment. The End to End example that covers both Device Management as well as data ingest comes in addition to the [various tutorials](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_CP_IOT_CF/Cloud/en-US) that are part of the documentation.

The document and the code snippets will provide a complete end to end [samples](samples) of how to use the SAP Cloud Platform Internet of Things for the Cloud Foundry Environment.

The Internet of Things Edge Platform requires pre-configured data models in order to publish data using specific protocol. All those data models including the automation script are collected under the [protocols](protocols) directory.
